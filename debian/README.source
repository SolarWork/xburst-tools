This Debian package is developed in a Git repository (see the Vcs-Git field
of debian/control).  To build from a git checkout:

	debian/rules get-orig-source REPO=. BRANCH=remotes/origin/debian
	mv xburst-tools_*.tar.gz ..
	debian/autogen.sh
	debuild

This requires a mipsel-openwrt-linux- cross-toolchain in your $PATH.  You
can get one by building the development environment from Qi Hardware, for
example.

  git://projects.qi-hardware.com/openwrt-xburst.git xburst

See the Qi Hardware wiki for details.

To build a released version of this package, no special instructions apply.
“dpkg-buildpackage” or “apt-get -b source xburst-tools” should work as
usual.
